  // the base branch into the working tree, the harness resolves the conflict
  // markers (see conflictResolveHarnessPrompt in agent.ts), and cloud finalizes
  // and pushes the merge commit. It engages ONLY when an authorized commenter
  // posts the directive (see CONFLICT_DIRECTIVE_PATTERN), never on ordinary PR
  // events. Inert until cloud models this capability + the merge-in-tree setup
  // (tracked in AgentWorkforce/cloud): with no merge, the harness finds no
