/**
 * pr-reviewer handler — review, apply mechanical safe fixes, and shepherd a PR
 * to the finish line.
 *
 *   an authorized approval (pull_request_review.submitted) → merge the PR.
 *   merge-on-green label + green checks + bot approvals     → merge the PR.
 *   a check run that finished green (check_run.completed)   → maybe merge-on-green, otherwise nothing to do.
 *   anything else — opened, new commits (synchronize), a
 *   review comment, failed CI, changes requested            → (re)review and fix.
 *
 * The PR's repo is materialized into ctx.sandbox.cwd by cloud before the
 * harness runs. The agent may leave only mechanical fixes there; cloud commits
 * and pushes those edits after the harness exits — no git/gh in the harness.
 *
 * Review comment: rendered by code from the json report the harness ends its
 * reply with (see renderReview) — a P0/P1/P2 verdict heading, then each finding
 * as a permalink GitHub shows as a code snippet. A run that fails, or whose
 * commit was replaced by a newer push while it ran, posts nothing.
 *
 * Ready signal: the review comment says the PR is a human's turn only when it
 * genuinely is — checks green, every bot/reviewer comment resolved, nothing left
 * for the agent to fix (the agent's READY sentinel).
